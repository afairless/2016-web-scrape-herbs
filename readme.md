This program downloads information on herbs and supplements listed by the U. S. 
National Library of Medicine (NLM).  The NLM webpage lists herbs and supplements 
from several sources; this program downloads only fact sheets (in 'pdf' format)
from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).  The
fact sheets are saved in a new directory created in the present working directory.

This program also saves a list of the herbs and supplements for which fact sheets
were downloaded.  The list is saved in a text file in the same directory where
the fact sheets are saved.

The purpose of this project was to let me learn and practice web scraping and 
Python programming.  Much of the code is based on Chapter 11 ('Web Scraping') of 
'Automate the Boring Stuff' by Al Sweigart:
